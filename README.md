# ConsultantFlow

This is a NextJS application for managing a pool of consultants, generated by Firebase Studio.

## Getting Started

To get started, explore the application by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The main pages are:
- **Landing Page**: `src/app/page.tsx`
- **Consultant Dashboard**: `src/app/consultant/[id]/page.tsx`
- **Admin Console**: `src/app/admin/page.tsx`

## Solution Highlights

ConsultantFlow is an intelligent workforce management platform designed to streamline the administration of a consultant pool. By integrating AI-powered agents, it automates key processes, provides data-driven insights, and enhances both consultant engagement and operational efficiency. The solution transitions the management process from manual tracking and subjective assessments to an automated, objective, and scalable system.

## Key Features & Approach

1.  **AI-Powered Resume & Certificate Analysis**:
    *   **Approach**: Leverages Genkit and Google's Gemini models to create specialized AI agents (`skill-vector-generator`, `training-agent`). These agents analyze unstructured documents (resumes, certificates) provided as data URIs.
    *   **Feature**: The system automatically extracts technical skills, rates proficiency on a 1-10 scale with detailed reasoning, and provides actionable feedback for training. This data populates the consultant's skill profile, making it immediately available for matching and reporting.

2.  **Unified Consultant & Admin Dashboards**:
    *   **Approach**: The application utilizes Next.js with Server Components to fetch initial data and interactive "client" components (built with React and ShadCN UI) for a dynamic user experience.
    *   **Feature**: Consultants access a personalized dashboard to view their workflow progress, skills, and suggested opportunities. Administrators use a central console to search, filter, and manage the entire consultant pool, generate reports, and trigger AI analyses.

3.  **Intelligent Opportunity Center**:
    *   **Approach**: A matching algorithm within the `OpportunityCenter` component cross-references the consultant's AI-verified skills against a list of available job roles, each detailed with required skills, experience, and responsibilities.
    *   **Feature**: The system doesn't just list jobs; it actively suggests the most relevant opportunities, marked with a "Suggested" badge. Consultants can select multiple roles and export the details as a single, consolidated PDF for their records.

4.  **Automated Engagement & Performance Feedback**:
    *   **Approach**: AI agents (`opportunity-agent`, `attendance-agent`) generate personalized feedback based on the consultant's activity data (attendance records, opportunity engagement metrics).
    *   **Feature**: With a single click, consultants can receive tailored advice. For example, the attendance agent provides motivational messages and calculates what is needed to meet company benchmarks, fostering a culture of accountability and self-improvement.


## Technologies Used

The application is built with a modern, robust, and scalable technology stack:

*   **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (with React) for a high-performance, server-first web application.
*   **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for robust type-safety and improved developer experience.
*   **Backend**:
    *   **Next.js Server Actions**: Handle the application's core business logic, such as creating and updating consultant data, running securely on the server.
    *   **Genkit**: Serves as the dedicated backend for all Generative AI tasks, orchestrating calls to [Google's Gemini models](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/).
*   **Database**: For this prototype, a **simulated in-memory database** (`src/lib/data.ts`) is used to store consultant data. In a production scenario, this would be replaced with a scalable database like Firestore or a SQL database.
*   **UI Components**: [ShadCN UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for a set of accessible, and composable components.
*   **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for a utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development.
*   **Forms**: [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) and [Zod](https://zod.dev/) for efficient, type-safe form validation.
*   **Data Visualization**: [Recharts](https://recharts.org/) for creating beautiful and interactive charts.
*   **Icons**: [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/) for a clean and consistent set of icons.
*   **PDF Generation**: [jsPDF](https://github.com/parallax/jsPDF) for client-side PDF creation.
*   **Hosting**: Deployed on [Firebase App Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-hosting) for a secure, scalable, and fully-managed hosting solution.
